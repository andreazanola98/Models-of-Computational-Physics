# Models-of-Computational-Physics

These projects are three of the most difficult problems assigned during the course of "Metodi Computazioni per la Fisica". These pieces of code are for all those students that for the first time they have to implement a code to solve some physical problems. Only some base knowledge of Matlab is required.

## Fermi Pasta Ulam (FPU) Problem
In 1955 Fermi, Pasta and Ulam had the idea to use (and test) one of the first computer ever built (Maniac I), on a simple physical problem: verify the equipartition theorem. For simplicity FPU considered a one dimensional chain with N points of mass m, one linked to an other with a spring with constant k. They consider also fixed boundary conditions.  In order to verify the equipartition theorem they introduce a non linear term in the equation of motion. They belived that after a certain time, all the modes start to be active. Instead they found that after a long time (FPU Superperiod), only the initial excited nodes becomes active, and so the equipartition theorem was not verified.
